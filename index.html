    <p> My name is Sarah Somers and I live in rural Nevada.  I have been a school teacher for the past 8 years and prior to that had positions in district administrative duties and banking.  I have started a journey in web programming and web design and have enjoyed learning something new!  Aside from work, I love travel, running and fitness, my dogs, and spending time with my teenage kids.  I also own a business, a fitness gym, which has been such a fun challenge.  I look forward to starting my new chapter in web design and programming.  Please reach out to me with any questions! </p>
