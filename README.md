A personal portfolio to showcase my work as a beginning web programmer --> Start here!
  
I am currently working to achieve my full-stack web devleopment certification through MIT XPRO.  To be honest, coding has been the most challenging thing I have ever learned! Oddly, on the same note, I have become obsessive with the work and absolutely love learning more about web development every day. This portfolio is a place for me to show my capabilities and I intend to update it regularly.  The ouline of this portfolio is as follows:

Home Page - Fun Photos - Contact Info - Resume

At this point the portfolio is very basic in structure with a home page and links to additional pages, all seperate from each other.  

My three samples of work are all single documents with HTML, CSS and JS coded all inline.  At the time of completing this project, this is what made sense to me.  

As I improve my portfolio, I would make the following changes:
-Sample work in seperate files and have them as seperate Github repositories that are linked accordingly.  
-Updated user experience with better navbars and functionality.
-Updated styling with a more modern design.
-The use of React and a 3 tiered server design.
-Integration of AWS to manage my portfolio.
